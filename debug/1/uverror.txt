 The error occurs because you have a conflicting virtual environment setup. Here's WHAT is happening and HOW to fix it:

  WHY This Happens

  - You activated a local .venv in the cbig directory
  - But uv detected a project environment at /Users/cjmacbook/dv/tools/.venv (parent directory)
  - uv is ignoring your activated environment and using its own

  HOW to Fix - 3 Options:

  Option 1: Use uv's environment directly (RECOMMENDED)
  cd /Users/cjmacbook/dv/tools/code-extractor/cbig
  deactivate  # Exit the current venv
  uv sync
  uv run cbig main -p .
  No need to activate anything - uv run handles it automatically.

  Option 2: Force uv to use your active environment
  cd /Users/cjmacbook/dv/tools/code-extractor/cbig
  source .venv/bin/activate
  uv sync --active
  uv run cbig main -p .

  Option 3: Clean slate approach
  cd /Users/cjmacbook/dv/tools/code-extractor/cbig
  deactivate
  rm -rf .venv
  rm -rf /Users/cjmacbook/dv/tools/.venv
  uv venv
  uv sync
  uv run cbig main -p .

  WHEN to use each:

  - Option 1: Fastest, cleanest - let uv manage everything
  - Option 2: If you need a specific venv active for other tools
  - Option 3: If environments are corrupted or conflicting

  Just run Option 1 commands and CBIG will work immediately.
